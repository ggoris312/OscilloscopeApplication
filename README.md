# OscilliscopeApplication

## Notes

C# application to test the connection to an oscilloscope to send commands such as retrieving a set of data it was reading.
This was created to automate a process in which an arduino fires a wave, and the oscilloscope reads the result.

If i later work on this, i will change it to use WPF to establish a GUI instead of using the console.

The connection is established and numbers are taken from it.
